Createdafile "my_file.txt" using 'w' mode which writes content on a file by deleting the existing content and reolacing it with new content. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file with the specified conditions.
I added content to the file using the .write function
Read the content of the file using .read function. I did not include 'r' mode because it would instead write a new file.I then introduced the print function for the output to be displayed on the console.
I also modified the content of 'my_file.txt' using 'a' mode. This append the file and adds new content to  the file as continuation without deleting any existing content. If the file does not exist,'a' creates a new file.
